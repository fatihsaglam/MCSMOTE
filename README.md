# MCSMOTE

This repository contains the R implementation of **MCSMOTE (Transition Matrix-Driven Oversampling)** proposed in:

Sağlam, F., & Cengiz, M. A. (2025).  
*MCSMOTE: A transition matrix-driven oversampling technique for class imbalance.*  
Applied Soft Computing, 113906.

## Summary

MCSMOTE is an oversampling method for imbalanced classification that constructs a Gaussian kernel-based similarity matrix among minority class instances and transforms it into a doubly stochastic transition matrix via Sinkhorn normalization. Synthetic samples are generated by probabilistically selecting minority instance pairs according to this transition matrix and applying interpolation, enabling structure-aware and data-driven sample generation.

## Code

The implementation of the algorithm is provided in resamplerCls_MCSMOTE.R.
