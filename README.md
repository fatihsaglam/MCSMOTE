# MCSMOTE

This repository contains the R implementations of **MCSMOTE (Transition Matrix-Driven Oversampling)** proposed in:

Sağlam, F., & Cengiz, M. A. (2025).  
*MCSMOTE: A transition matrix-driven oversampling technique for class imbalance.*  
Applied Soft Computing, 113906.

## Summary

MCSMOTE is an oversampling method for imbalanced classification. It constructs a Gaussian kernel-based similarity matrix among minority class instances and transforms it into a doubly stochastic transition matrix via Sinkhorn normalization. Synthetic samples are generated by probabilistically selecting minority instance pairs according to this transition structure and applying interpolation, enabling structure-aware and data-driven sample generation.

## Applications and Code

The applications reported in the article and the R implementation of the method are provided in TMMCSMOTE.R.
